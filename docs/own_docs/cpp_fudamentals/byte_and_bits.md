# Bytes and Bits

A byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight
bits. A bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital
communications, which can have only one of two values, often represented as 0
or 1.

Here is a brief description of the C++ primitive types, including their binary
and hexadecimal representations for the value `7` as an example:

1. `bool`: Boolean type, values can be `true` or `false`. Binary and
   hexadecimal representation isn't typically used with booleans.

2. `char`: Character type. It's exactly one byte in C++. Binary: `00000111`,
   Hexadecimal: `07`

3. `int`: Integer type. Its size can vary, but it's at least 2 bytes in C++.
   Binary: `00000000 00000111` for 2 bytes, Hexadecimal: `0007` for 2 bytes.

4. `float` and `double`: Floating point types. The size of `float` is 4 bytes,
   and the size of `double` is 8 bytes. These types use a complex
   representation that's not easily readable in binary or hexadecimal.

5. `void`: The type specifier `void` indicates that no value is available.

6. `wchar_t`: A wide character type. Its size is compiler-specific, with binary
   and hexadecimal representations depending on its width.

Note that the sizes of the types can vary between different systems and
compilers. You can always use the `sizeof` operator in C++ to get the size of a
specific type on your system.

Also note that the binary and hexadecimal representations depend on the
specific value of the variable. The examples above are for the value `7`.

The C++ standard library also includes several integer types with specified
widths, such as `int16_t`, `uint32_t`, `int64_t`, etc. These types are useful
when you need integers of a specific size.

Keep in mind, bit-level representations for floating-point types (`float`,
`double`) are complex due to the way floating-point values are stored, which
involves a sign, a mantissa, and an exponent. The binary and hexadecimal
representations of these types are not straightforward like they are for
integers.
