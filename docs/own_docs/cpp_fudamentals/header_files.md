# Header Files

- Headers are a fundamental aspect of C++ as they provide the declarations of
  libraries, classes, functions, and variables, which can be used across multiple
  files. Here's a table covering headers and their related concepts:

**Headers and Preprocessing in C++**

| **Concept**                  | **Description**                                                                                                          | **Code Example**                                    | **Common Usages**                         | **Best Practices**                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Library Headers** | Headers that come with the C++ Standard Library.                                                                         | `#include <iostream>`                               | Accessing standard functionality.         | Use angle brackets (`< >`). Prefer standard libraries when possible.   |
| **User-defined Headers**     | Headers created by the developer for a particular project or library.                                                    | `#include "myheader.h"`                             | Separating declarations and definitions.  | Use quotes (`" "`). Keep organized and modular.                        |
| **Header Guards**            | Prevents double inclusion of headers, which can cause redefinition errors.                                               | `#ifndef MYHEADER_H #define MYHEADER_H ... #endif`  | Every user-defined header file.           | Always use. Prefer `#pragma once` if supported.                        |
| **Forward Declaration**      | Declare an entity before defining it, allowing for separation of declaration and definition.                             | `class MyClass;`                                    | Reduce compile time, cyclic dependencies. | Use to minimize header dependencies.                                   |
| **Preprocessor Directives**  | Instructions to the preprocessor about what to do before actual compilation starts.                                      | `#define PI 3.14159`                                | Macros, conditional compilation.          | Use sparingly. Prefer `constexpr` for constants. Avoid complex macros. |
| **Precompiled Headers**      | A feature that compiles common header files once, then uses the precompiled version to speed up the compilation process. | (Toolchain dependent, often: `stdafx.h` or `pch.h`) | Large projects with stable headers.       | Ensure headers in the precompiled header rarely change.                |

**General Notes**:

- Always ensure your headers contain only necessary declarations to prevent
bloat and longer compile times.
- Headers ensure modularity and help in managing large codebases.
- Avoid putting using-directives (like `using namespace std;`) in headers; they
can lead to namespace pollution and ambiguous references in source files.
- Try to minimize dependencies in headers to improve compilation times. If a
forward declaration is enough, prefer it over a full `#include`.

Headers and preprocessing play a crucial role in shaping the structure and
efficiency of C++ projects. Properly managing and organizing headers can lead
to more maintainable and efficient code.
