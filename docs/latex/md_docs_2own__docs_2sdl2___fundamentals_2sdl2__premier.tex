The SDL2 and its extensions you downloaded using the script are dynamic libraries. When you use a package manager like Homebrew on mac\+OS to install libraries, it typically installs the dynamic versions of the libraries.

Dynamic libraries are preferred in most cases as they allow programs to share code which is loaded into memory only once, thereby saving memory. They also enable you to update the library separately from the application that uses it.

However, dynamic libraries do come with a caveat\+: the library version that the application was linked against at compile time must be available at runtime as well. If the library is updated to a version that is not backward-\/compatible, applications that depend on it may break.

On the other hand, static libraries are incorporated into the application at compile time. This makes the application self-\/contained and ensures it won\textquotesingle{}t break due to library updates, but it may lead to larger binary sizes and duplication of library code in memory if multiple applications use the same library.

In most cases, you will find both static and dynamic versions of a library available for your use, and you can choose the one that best suits your application\textquotesingle{}s needs.
