# Pointers and References in Depth

## Pointer representation style

All the way to declare the pointer focus on the \* position
Also same for the reference and let me know who are using such way

- Pointers and references in C++ can be declared in various ways. Note that the
  position of the asterisk (\*) or ampersand (&) is flexible and doesn't change
  the meaning of the declaration. The following are all valid declarations of
  pointers:

```cpp
int* p;
int *p;
int * p;
```

- All these statements declare `p` as a pointer to `int`.

- For references, it is the same:

```cpp
int& r = someInt;
int &r = someInt;
int & r = someInt;
```

All these statements declare `r` as a reference to `int`. As for which style to
use, it's mainly a matter of personal or team preference. The key is to be
consistent throughout your codebase to avoid confusion. Some people prefer
`int* p` because it reads as "p is a pointer to an int". Others prefer `int *p`
as it emphasizes that `*p` is an int. The same applies to reference types. It's
worth noting that the position of the asterisk or ampersand doesn't affect the
actual behavior of the program. It's purely a stylistic choice. However, when
declaring multiple pointers or references in one line, the position does
matter:

```cpp
int* p1, p2; // p1 is a pointer to int, but p2 is just an int
int *p1, *p2; // both p1 and p2 are pointers to int
```

In this case, `int* p1, p2;` might mislead someone to think that `p2` is also a
pointer, which is not the case. Therefore, some coding guidelines recommend
declaring each variable on a separate line to avoid such confusion.

## Char pointer and char pointer to pointer in C++

In C++, a "char pointer" and a "char pointer to pointer" (also known
as a "pointer to char pointer" or "pointer to pointer to char") are both
concepts related to handling strings and arrays of characters.

1. **Char Pointer (char\*)**:
   A char pointer (`char*`) is a pointer variable that holds the memory address
   of a single character or the first character of a sequence of characters (a
   string). It's used to point to the memory location where a character or a
   series of characters are stored.

For example:

```cpp
const char* str = "Hello, World!"; // Points to the first character 'H'
char ch = *str; // Dereferencing gets the first character 'H'
```

Char pointers can be used to navigate through strings and perform various
string-related operations using pointer arithmetic.

2. **Char Pointer to Pointer (char**) or Pointer to Char Pointer\*\*: A char
   pointer to pointer (`char\*\*`) is a pointer variable that holds the memory
   address of another char pointer. Essentially, it's a way of pointing to a char
   pointer. This can be useful when dealing with arrays of strings, like an array
   of C-style strings (char arrays), where each element is a char pointer.

For example:

```cpp
const char* strings[] = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange"};
const char** ptrToStr = strings; // Points to the first element "Apple"
const char* firstString = *ptrToStr; // Dereferencing gets "Apple"
```

Char pointers to pointers are often used in situations where you need to
manipulate or access a collection of strings or dynamically allocated memory,
like when handling command-line arguments, parsing text files, or dynamic
arrays of strings.

Overall, both char pointers and char pointers to pointers are fundamental
concepts in C++ that allow for efficient manipulation and management of strings
and character data. However, when working in C++, it's generally recommended to
use `std::string` and modern string handling facilities provided by the C++
Standard Library, as they offer safer and more convenient ways to work with
strings.

## What are the uses of [] and {} in C++

In C++, both `[]` and `{}` have distinct uses and meanings.

1. **Square Brackets `[]`**:

   - **Array Declaration and Access**: Square brackets are primarily used for
     declaring and accessing arrays. For example:

     ```cpp
     int numbers[5]; // Declare an array of 5 integers
     numbers[0] = 10; // Assign a value to the first element
     int x = numbers[2]; // Access the third element
     ```

   - **Indexing**: Square brackets are also used for indexing elements in
     arrays and other container-like structures (like `std::vector` or
     `std::string`):

     ```cpp
     std::string text = "Hello";
     char thirdChar = text[2]; // Access the third character 'l'
     ```

2. **Curly Braces `{}`**:

   - **Initialization**: Curly braces are often used for initializing various
     types of data, including arrays, structs, classes, and fundamental types:

     ```cpp
     int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initialize an integer array
     std::string greeting{"Hello, World!"}; // Initialize a string
     ```

   - **Initializer Lists**: Curly braces can be used to create initializer
     lists, which can simplify the initialization of containers and user-defined
     types:

     ```cpp
     std::vector<int> values = {10, 20, 30}; // Initialize a vector with values
     ```

   - **Uniform Initialization**: Curly braces are part of the uniform
     initialization syntax, which provides a consistent way to initialize objects
     regardless of their type. This helps avoid ambiguity and narrowing
     conversion issues:

     ```cpp
     int x{5}; // Initialize an integer using uniform initialization
     ```

   - **Aggregate Initialization**: Curly braces can be used to initialize
     aggregate types (arrays and structs) by specifying values for their members:

     ```cpp
     struct Point { int x; int y; };
     Point p = {3, 7}; // Initialize a Point struct
     ```

   - **Nested Initialization**: Curly braces can be nested for nested structures or containers:
     ```cpp
     std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}; // Initialize a 2D vector
     ```

Both square brackets and curly braces have important roles in C++ programming
and are used in various contexts for array handling, data initialization, and
container manipulation. Understanding their specific uses will help you write
more efficient and expressive code.

## Double Pointers in CPP

In C++, a double pointer (or a pointer to a pointer) is essentially a pointer
that points to another pointer, allowing for multiple levels of indirection.

Double pointers can be used in several scenarios:

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation: One of the main uses of double pointers is to
   dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array.
2. Linked Data Structures: Double pointers can be helpful in more complex data
   structures, like trees or graphs. For instance, in a binary tree, double
   pointers can be used to handle the root node, so the entire tree can be
   modified if necessary.
3. Function Arguments: If you want a function to change the value of a pointer
   passed to it, you need to pass a pointer to the pointer.

Here's an example for each case:

1. Dynamic Memory Allocation:

```cpp
int **array2D = new int*[row];
for(int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
    array2D[i] = new int[col];
}
```

In this example, `array2D` is a double pointer. It first points to an array of
pointers, then each of these pointers points to an array of ints, creating a 2D
array.

2. Binary Tree:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};

void insert(Node** root, int data) {
    if (*root == NULL) {
        *root = new Node();
        (*root)->data = data;
        (*root)->left = NULL;
        (*root)->right = NULL;
    } else if (data < (*root)->data) {
        insert(&(*root)->left, data);
    } else {
        insert(&(*root)->right, data);
    }
}
```

In this example, `root` is a double pointer. The `insert` function can modify
`root` so that it points to a new node, effectively changing the tree's root.

3. Function Arguments:

```cpp
void changePointer(int** ptr) {
    *ptr = new int(10);
}

int main() {
    int* ptr = NULL;
    changePointer(&ptr);
    cout << *ptr << endl;  // Output: 10
    delete ptr;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `changePointer` function changes what `ptr` points to.
Without a double pointer, this change would not be reflected outside the
function.

## More details

Assume we have `{“first sentence”, “second sentence” }` how to access this
using pointer to pointer The structure you're dealing with is an array of
C-style strings, which is essentially an array of character arrays. In C++, we
can access this using a pointer to a pointer. Here's a simple breakdown:

- **Character** (`char`): The smallest unit in this case, a single letter or symbol.
- **String** (`char*` or `char[]`): A series of characters, essentially a pointer to the first character.
- **Array of Strings** (`char**` or `char*[]`): An array of pointers, where each pointer refers to a string.

You can think of `char**` as a "pointer to a pointer to a character". Here's how you could declare and use this:

```cpp
const char* sentences[] = {"first sentence", "second sentence"};  // Array of pointers to chars
const char** ptr = sentences; // Pointer to the array of pointers
```

To access individual strings, you can dereference `ptr`:

```cpp
std::cout << ptr[0]; // Output: "first sentence"
std::cout << ptr[1]; // Output: "second sentence"
```

To access individual characters, you can use double subscript:

```cpp
std::cout << ptr[0][0]; // Output: 'f'
std::cout << ptr[1][0]; // Output: 's'
```

or dereference the pointer twice:

```cpp
std::cout << **ptr; // Output: 'f'
```

In the last example, `*ptr` gives you the first string ("first sentence"), and
`**ptr` gives you the first character of the first string. Note that since
these are C-style strings, they are null-terminated. That means the memory
location after the last character of each string is a null character (`\0`).

## What are the use cases of pointer to pointer in cpp

Pointers to pointers (or multi-level pointers) in C++ have several use cases:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation for Multi-dimensional Arrays**: Pointers to
   pointers are often used to dynamically allocate memory for multi-dimensional
   arrays. This is particularly useful when the array's dimensions are not known
   at compile time.

   ```cpp
   int **array = new int*[rows];
   for(int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
       array[i] = new int[cols];
   ```

2. **Changing the Memory Address Pointed by a Pointer**: If you want a function
   to change the memory address a pointer is pointing to, you would need to
   pass a pointer to the pointer.

   ```cpp
   void changePtr(int** pp){
       *pp = new int(10);
   }
   int *p = new int(5);
   changePtr(&p);
   ```

3. **Data Structures**: Pointers to pointers are commonly used in more complex
   data structures. For example, in a binary tree, if you want to change the
   root of the tree, you would likely need a pointer to the pointer of the root.
   Similarly, in linked lists, if you need to insert a node at the beginning, you
   would need a pointer to the head pointer to change the head of the list.

4. **Function Pointers**: Pointers to function pointers are used in scenarios
   where there is a need to change the pointed function at runtime.

Remember, while pointers to pointers can be powerful, they can also lead to
more complex code and potential errors, especially around memory management. So
it's important to use them judiciously.

## How to create a pointer

In C++, you can create a pointer in a number of ways. Here are some examples:

1. **Pointer to an existing variable:**

```cpp
int var = 10;
int *ptr = &var; // ptr now points to var
```

In this case, `ptr` is a pointer to an integer and it's assigned the address of
`var` using the `&` operator.

2. **Pointer to a dynamically allocated memory (heap memory):**

```cpp
int *ptr = new int(10); // ptr points to a new int initialized to 10
```

Here, `new` operator allocates memory on the heap and returns the address of that memory.

3. **Pointer to an array:**

```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int *ptr = arr; // ptr points to the first element of arr
```

Here, array `arr` decays to the pointer to its first element. You can move through the array using pointer arithmetic.

4. **Pointer to a C-style string (null-terminated character array):**

```cpp
char *ptr = "Hello, world!";
```

Here, `ptr` points to a string literal which is a character array.

5. **Pointer to pointer (double pointer):**

```cpp
int var = 10;
int *ptr = &var;
int **doublePtr = &ptr; // doublePtr now points to ptr
```

Here, `doublePtr` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer. These are some of
the basic examples of using pointers in C++. Each case is used in different
scenarios and can handle different types of data. The important part is to
understand how they work and when each case is appropriate to use.
