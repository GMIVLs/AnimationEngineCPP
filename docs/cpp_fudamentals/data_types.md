# Data Types in CPP

- Let's cover the fundamental built-in data types in C++. The sizes of these
  data types can vary depending on the architecture and compiler used, but I'll
  give you a typical size on a modern system (such as a 64-bit machine using a
  GCC or Clang compiler). You mentioned types like `upsize_t`, but I believe you
  meant types like `size_t` or perhaps types with a suffix like `_t`. These are
  typedefs in the C++ standard library.

Here's a table for built-in data types:

| **Data Type** | **Description**           | **Bytes (Hex)** | **Size (Bytes)** | **Example**                |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `bool`        | Boolean value.            | 0x01            | 1                | `bool flag = true;`        |
| `char`        | Character/byte.           | 0x01            | 1                | `char ch = 'A';`           |
| `wchar_t`     | Wide character.           | 0x02 or 0x04    | 2 or 4           | `wchar_t wch = L'A';`      |
| `short`       | Short integer.            | 0x02            | 2                | `short sh = 100;`          |
| `int`         | Integer.                  | 0x04            | 4                | `int num = 1000;`          |
| `long`        | Long integer.             | 0x04 or 0x08    | 4 or 8           | `long ln = 10000L;`        |
| `long long`   | Very long integer.        | 0x08            | 8                | `long long ll = 100000LL;` |
| `float`       | Floating point number.    | 0x04            | 4                | `float fl = 10.5f;`        |
| `double`      | Double floating point.    | 0x08            | 8                | `double db = 10.5;`        |
| `long double` | Extended precision float. | 0x10 or varies  | 16 or varies     | `long double ldb = 10.5L;` |

For typedefs that are commonly used:

| **Data Type** | **Description**                          | **Typical Bytes (Hex)** | **Typical Size (Bytes)** | **Example**                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `size_t`      | Unsigned type of the result of `sizeof`. | 0x08                    | 8                        | `size_t sz = sizeof(int);`                              |
| `ptrdiff_t`   | Signed type to hold pointer subtraction. | 0x08                    | 8                        | `ptrdiff_t diff = p2 - p1;` (where p1, p2 are pointers) |
| `int8_t`      | Fixed-width 8-bit integer.               | 0x01                    | 1                        | `int8_t val = 10;`                                      |
| `uint8_t`     | Fixed-width unsigned 8-bit integer.      | 0x01                    | 1                        | `uint8_t uval = 10;`                                    |

... and so on for `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t` and their unsigned counterparts.

Please note:

- The sizes are given for typical modern systems. Always use the `sizeof`
  operator to verify sizes in your specific system.
- `_t` suffix types are part of the C++ standard library (specifically from the
  `<cstdint>` header) and represent fixed-width integer types.

Also, remember to include the appropriate headers when working with specific
data types, especially the typedefs.

## Representation in Memory

Given the complexity and extensiveness of this request, this table will give a
comprehensive view of basic primitive data types. Some sizes are
platform-dependent (specifically, architecture like 32-bit vs. 64-bit systems
can affect them), but the table provides general sizes for a typical 64-bit
system. For non-primitive types like string, array, map, their size is more
complicated and depends on their content and implementation.

| **Data Type** | **Size (bytes)** | **Example (hex)**    | **Example (binary)** | **Memory Representation** | **Range**                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `char`        | 1                | `0x41`               | `01000001`           | 8 bits                    | -128 to 127 (or 0 to 255 for `unsigned char`)           |
| `short`       | 2                | `0x0123`             | `0000000100100011`   | 16 bits                   | -32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| `int`         | 4                | `0x01234567`         | 32 bits              | 32 bits                   | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| `long`        | 8 (typically)    | `0x0123456789ABCDEF` | 64 bits              | 64 bits                   | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| `float`       | 4                | Depends on value     | Depends on value     | IEEE 754                  | ~1.4E-45 to ~3.4E38                                     |
| `double`      | 8                | Depends on value     | Depends on value     | IEEE 754                  | ~5.0E-324 to ~1.7E308                                   |
| `bool`        | 1 (typically)    | N/A                  | `00000001` (true)    | 8 bits                    | `true` or `false`                                       |
| `wchar_t`     | 2 or 4           | Depends on value     | Depends on value     | Platform-dependent        | Platform-dependent                                      |
| `long long`   | 8                | `0x0123456789ABCDEF` | 64 bits              | 64 bits                   | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |

For non-primitive types:

| **Data Type** | **Base Size (bytes)**                 | **Notes**                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `std::string` | Depends on implementation and content | Size is dynamic, depends on the number of characters stored + overhead.                       |
| `std::array`  | Depends on type and size              | Size is `sizeof(type) * number_of_elements`.                                                  |
| `std::vector` | Dynamic                               | Size changes as elements are added/removed. Memory is allocated on the heap.                  |
| `std::map`    | Dynamic                               | Size depends on the number of key-value pairs and the types used. Memory usually on the heap. |

**Notes**:

1. The exact size of some data types can vary between platforms and compilers.
2. For non-primitive types, the actual memory used can be more due to dynamic
   allocations, especially for data structures that manage their memory like
   `std::string` or `std::vector`.
3. Modern C++ provides fixed-width integer types in the header `<cstdint>`,
   like `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`, etc., which have sizes guaranteed to
   be 2, 4, and 8 bytes, respectively.

To get the exact size of any type in a specific environment, one can use the
`sizeof` operator in C++. For instance, `sizeof(int)` will give the size of an
int in bytes for the specific platform/compiler being used.

## Block Memory given same number

Alright, we'll create a table that provides a memory block view of integer and
floating-point numbers for the examples you provided. We will focus on a 32-bit
representation for both integers (using `int`) and floating-point numbers
(using `float`) for simplicity. Note that the representation might vary
depending on the system and compiler.

| **Type/Value** | **Hex Representation** | **Binary Representation**             | **Memory Profile (byte-by-byte)** |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| int (14)       | `0x0000000E`           | `00000000 00000000 00000000 00001110` | 00 00 00 0E                       |
| int (-14)      | `0xFFFFFFF2`           | `11111111 11111111 11111111 11110010` | FF FF FF F2                       |
| float (14.0)   | `0x41700000`           | `01000001 01110000 00000000 00000000` | 41 70 00 00                       |
| float (-14.0)  | `0xC1700000`           | `11000001 01110000 00000000 00000000` | C1 70 00 00                       |

**Memory Profile Explanation**:

- For `int`, it's a straightforward 2's complement representation.
- For `float`, it uses IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point format, where
  the first bit is the sign bit (1 for negative, 0 for positive), followed by an
  8-bit exponent, and then a 23-bit fraction (or mantissa).

**Note**: The floating-point representation might not be intuitive just by looking
at the binary. It's a mix of sign, exponent, and fractional bits. The exact
binary and hex representation for floating-point numbers might vary based on
the specifics of the IEEE 754 implementation in a particular environment.

- The "Memory Profile (byte-by-byte)" column presents a big-endian view. Actual
  representation in memory could be little-endian on some systems, which means
  the bytes would be in reverse order.

- Representing the string "abc" in various formats, keeping in mind a 32-bit system (and assuming an 8-bit `char`):

1. **String Literal (C-Style)**: Strings are null-terminated sequences of
   characters. For the string "abc", it is represented as 'a', 'b', 'c', and
   '\0'.
2. **std::string**: This is a more complex data type from the C++ Standard
   Library, and its internal representation can differ based on the
   implementation. A `std::string` typically contains a pointer to dynamic memory
   where the actual string is stored, a size, and a capacity. The dynamic memory
   would hold our 'a', 'b', 'c', and '\0'.

| **Type/Value**                 | **Hex Representation**         | **Binary Representation**             | **Memory Profile (byte-by-byte)**             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| String Literal "abc"           | `0x61626300`                   | `01100001 01100010 01100011 00000000` | 61 62 63 00                                   |
| std::string "abc" (simplified) | Varies based on implementation | Varies based on implementation        | Varies based on internal `std::string` layout |

**Memory Profile Explanation**:

- For the String Literal, "abc" is represented in ASCII values. The characters
  'a', 'b', and 'c' correspond to ASCII values 97, 98, and 99 respectively. The
  null terminator '\0' corresponds to ASCII value 0.
- For `std::string`, it's a bit more complicated. The internal representation
  will depend on the library's implementation and might include dynamic memory
  allocation. The hex and binary values will differ based on that representation.

Note: The memory profile provided is a simplistic representation. Actual memory
layout can differ based on system, compiler, and standard library version. For
a precise representation, one would have to delve into the specific
`std::string` implementation or use tools like memory profilers or debuggers.

## Memory Profile for Array

Let's start by setting a context: Let's consider an array, a vector, and a map, each storing pairs of integers, such as `(1,2)`, `(3,4)`, and `(5,6)`.

1. **Array**: In C++, an array is a fixed-size container. If we consider an
   array of pairs, we can represent it as `std::pair<int, int>[3]`.
2. **std::vector**: This is a dynamic array in C++. It has the flexibility to
   grow or shrink. The memory profile of a vector consists of pointers to
   dynamic memory, a size, and a capacity.
3. **std::map**: An associative container that stores elements in key-value
   pairs. Internally, many implementations of `std::map` use a balanced binary
   tree (like a red-black tree). This means each node contains a pair (key,
   value), and pointers to left and right child nodes.

Here's the table with a simple representation:

| **Type/Value**                                   | **Hex & Binary Representation** | **Memory Profile (byte-by-byte)**                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Array (`std::pair<int, int>[3]`)                 | Depends on layout in memory     | Sequence of 6 integers; no metadata (so, directly the hex values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)              |
| std::vector (`std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>`) | Varies with implementation      | Pointer(s) to dynamic memory, size, capacity; dynamic memory will have the hex values of the pairs |
| std::map (`std::map<int, int>`)                  | Varies with implementation      | Nodes with key-value pair and pointers to left/right child; exact memory profile varies            |

**Memory Profile Explanation**:

- **Array**: Straightforward sequence of data without any overhead or metadata.
- **std::vector**: Contains overhead for size, capacity, and pointer(s) to
dynamic memory. The dynamic memory contains the actual values.
- **std::map**: Due to its tree-based structure, there's significant overhead
for maintaining the tree (pointers to left and right children, maybe color
information for balancing, etc.), on top of the key-value data.

Note: The exact memory profile will depend on the system, compiler, and
standard library version. The representations above are simplifications to
convey the conceptual differences. Actual layouts, especially for complex
structures like `std::map`, may involve additional metadata and differ
substantially from this basic outline. For precise representation, specialized
tools or diving into specific library implementations would be necessary.
