## Logging information

Based on the provided code snippet, it appears that you are trying to use
Google's logging library (glog) to output log messages to a file (`logs.txt`),
and you are attempting to specify the log directory via the `FLAGS_log_dir`
flag. However, there are a few points to consider that might be affecting the
logging behavior:

1. **Directory vs File Path**:

   - The `FLAGS_log_dir` flag is supposed to specify the directory where log
     files should be stored, not the path to a specific log file. So, `LogPath`
     should be a directory, not a file path.
   - You can create a directory and point `FLAGS_log_dir` to that directory,
     and glog will create log files within that directory.

2. **Flag Setting Location**:

   - The `FLAGS_alsologtostderr` and `FLAGS_log_dir` flags should ideally be
     set before any logging is performed, and outside the loop. This is to
     ensure that the settings are applied to all log messages.

3. **Environment Variable**:

   - The `getenv("PROJECT_DIR")` function call is used to get the value of the
     `PROJECT_DIR` environment variable. Ensure that this environment variable
     is set correctly, and that the path it returns exists.

4. **Log File Naming**:
   - By default, glog creates log files with names based on the program's
     name, the date, and the hostname, so the log file might not be named
     `logs.txt`.

## Logging Snippet

A revised version of your code might look like this:

```c++
#include "lib/veclib/Vector_2d.h"
#include <SDL.h>
#include <SDL_image.h>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <glog/logging.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Initialize Google's logging library.
    google::InitGoogleLogging(argv[0]);

    const char *projectDir = getenv("PROJECT_DIR");
    if (!projectDir) {
        std::cerr << "PROJECT_DIR environment variable is not set." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Ensure this is a directory path, not a file path
    std::string logDirPath = std::string(projectDir) + "/logs";
    std::cout << "Log directory: " << logDirPath << std::endl;

    // Set logging flags
    FLAGS_alsologtostderr = 1;
    FLAGS_log_dir = logDirPath.c_str();

    for (size_t i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        std::cout << "Value of i -> { " << i << " }" << std::endl;
        LOG(INFO) << "This is an informational log message.";
        LOG(WARNING) << "This is a warning log message.";
        LOG(ERROR) << "This is an error log message.";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Logging meaning

In this revised code:

- Check is added to ensure that the `PROJECT_DIR` environment variable is set.
- `FLAGS_alsologtostderr` and `FLAGS_log_dir` are set before the logging loop.
- `logDirPath` is intended to be a directory path, not a file path.

Ensure that the directory specified in `logDirPath` exists or create it before
running the program. The log files generated by glog will be placed in this
directory, and you should be able to find them there.

The creation of these two files is a standard behavior of the Google logging
library (glog). Here's a breakdown of what these files represent and why they
are created:

1. **Log File with Detailed Name**
   (`main.GMacBookPro.local.gmbp.log.INFO.20231022-213046.33518`):

   - This is the actual log file containing the log messages.
   - The name encodes several pieces of information: the program name (`main`),
     the machine name (`GMacBookPro.local.gmbp`), the log severity level
     (`INFO`), the date and time (`20231022-213046`), and the process ID
     (`33518`).
   - This naming scheme helps in organizing and identifying log files,
     especially in environments with multiple running instances of the program or
     multiple programs logging to the same directory.

2. **Symlink (Symbolic Link) File** (`main.INFO`):
   - This file is a symbolic link (symlink) that points to the latest log file
     of the corresponding severity level (`INFO` in this case).
   - The symlink always points to the most recent log file for a given severity
     level, making it easier to find the latest log file without having to sift
     through potentially many log files in the directory.
   - The symlink gets updated to point to the newest log file whenever a new
     log file is created (e.g., due to log rotation or a new program instance).

This setup allows for a balance between detailed log file naming (for
organization and troubleshooting) and ease of access to the latest log data via
the symlink. This way, you can quickly access the latest log file by opening
`main.INFO`, or you can delve into the historical log files by looking at the
files with the more detailed names.
